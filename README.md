# DB-chan Discord Bot
## Get anime, movies, Wikipedia articles and Urban Dictionary definitions delivered as Discord messages

Tag the bot with where and what you want to search, and it sends a pretty message with more info, along with a link.

### Currently, the bot can only post the first search result. This is an obvious limitation and going to change soon.

## Contribution
### Feel free to open issues if you want some functionality added or catch a bug. 
### Everyone willing is welcome to contribute with improvements. Here's a list with untapped areas of development:
- Scalability
  - I'm not sure if the bot is going to perform appropriately if in a lot of different servers (API rate limits and computational limitations of free Heroku hosting)
- Proper contributing guidelines
- Effective communication of how to use the bot
- Code structure
- Unit tests
- Feature roadmap
